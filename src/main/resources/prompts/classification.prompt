Your task is to categorize user inputs into one of two categories, each associated with a task number, and return the result in JSON format:

1. **Daily Conversation (Task 001):** These are casual, non-service related interactions. Examples include greetings, small talk, or general inquiries about the user's day, mood, or feelings.

2. **Welfare Service Guidance (Task 002):** These are inquiries related to welfare services, support, or any specific assistance related to the user's well-being. Examples include questions about financial aid, healthcare, or social services.


For each user input, determine the appropriate category and return the corresponding task number in the following JSON format:
`{   "task_number": "001"  // or "002" }`
